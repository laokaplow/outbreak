Blah Blah Flaks, PCap blah blah, Jquery blah, Google Maps Blah

Easy Setup With Docker

Manual Setup for Development
-----
**This is just a test beep boop**

We'll start by installing some programs for our dependency management
```
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip 
$ sudo apt-get install npm
$ sudo npm install -g bower
```

We don't want to pollute your environment so install virtualenv
```
$ sudo pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv ./birdseye/lib/python_modules
$ source ./birdseye/lib/python_modules/bin/activate
```

Now we can safely install our deps
```
$ pip install -r test_requirements.txt
$ bower install
```

Now run the webserver accordingly
```
$ python ./manage.py runserver
```
